        <h3> A few quick rules and tips.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="quicklist">The letter "o" is pronouced as the "a" when unstressed. For example, the word "хорошо", though written like "ho-ro-sho" is actually pronounced "ha-ra-sho" (the last "o" being pronounced becuase that is where the stress of the word falls.) </li>
          <li class="quicklist">The "ъ" and "ь" are called "signs", and they modify the consonant they follow. The "ъ" is rarely used in modern Russian, but therorectically hardens the sound of the consonant that it follows. The "ь" is used failry often, and acts similarly, though it softens the consonant that it follows.</li>
          <li class="quicklist">The "й", though not considered a sign, fulfils esentially the same purpose of modifying the vowel it follows, and is has no real sound on its own. For example, "aй" is pronounced "ai" or "oй" is pronounced "oi" </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Хорошо! Let's try to make a word! Step by step.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Let's take this consonant: п (sounds like the 'p' in 'party')</li>
          <li>Then let's take this vowel: а (sounds like the 'a' in 'pack')</li>
          <li>Another п </li>
          <li>And another a </li>
          <li>п+a+п+a = папа! (papa)</li>
        </ol>
